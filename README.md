Background of the Enterprise:
	The business of choice is a small retail store specialized in homemade artisanal body care products, their premise is a personal approach with orders being placed in the website and then the products being manufactured in-premise and delivered appropriately. With that the business has seen a steady growth in costumer base and product offering requiring not only a physical expansion but also an optimisation in the IT infrastructure to accommodate the demand and increase reliability and scalability.
Current IT Setup:
	The current IT setup includes a small on premises server that hosts the website where the orders are handled, the local inventory with database management software and an email server for communication with suppliers and customer service.
Recommendations:
a. E-commerce Website Hosting:

Non-Cloud Solution: Continue with on-premises hosting.
Cloud Solution: Migrate the e-commerce website to a cloud hosting provider.
b. Inventory Management Database:

Non-Cloud Solution: Continue with the local database.
Cloud Solution: Migrate the database to a cloud-based database service.
c. Email Server:

Non-Cloud Solution: Continue with the in-house email server.
Cloud Solution: Migrate the email services to a cloud-based email service.
d. File Storage and Backups:

Non-Cloud Solution: Continue with traditional local file storage.
Cloud Solution: Adopt a cloud-based file storage and backup service.
e. Remote Access:

Non-Cloud Solution: Continue with VPN for remote access.
Cloud Solution: Implement a secure cloud-based remote access solution.
Recommendations with Service Level and Deployment Type:
a. E-commerce Website Hosting:

Cloud Recommendation: Utilize a Managed Cloud Hosting Service with auto-scaling capabilities to handle traffic spikes during peak seasons.
b. Inventory Management Database:

Cloud Recommendation: Opt for a Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) solution to ensure scalability and automated backups.
c. Email Server:

Cloud Recommendation: Choose a reputable Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) email provider to offload server management and ensure reliable email delivery.
d. File Storage and Backups:

Cloud Recommendation: Implement a Cloud Storage Service with automatic backups and versioning for data redundancy.
e. Remote Access:

Cloud Recommendation: Deploy a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with VPN access for secure remote connections.
Justifications:
Cloud solution provides better scalability, performance, allows the server to handle traffic spikes accordingly, high availability, data safety and redundancy ensuring flexibility not only with the website but with the data. Continuing with in-premises server would require constant upkeeping, ready on call IT service and hardware upgrades to accommodate traffic spikes which would use a lot of resources and time which could be used in others areas to expand the business.
